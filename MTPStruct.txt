>> HEADER <<
Unknown #1 (Activator?) | 2 bytes
Animation Count 	 | 2 bytes
Unknown #2 (Activator?) | 2 bytes 
Padding 			 | 0xA bytes 

>> DATA INFO/OFFSET TABLE (Starting at 0x10), This repeats for Animation Count Entries <<

Object Property Offset | 4 Bytes ## THIS IS AN OFFSET TO BEGINNING OF THE PREVIOUS! PROPERTY.
							     ## FOR THE FIRST PROPERTY, IT IS THE LENGTH OF THE SPECIFIC PROPERTY AT START OF MISC PROPERTIES.
								 ## WTF SANIC TEEM, THIS FORMAT IS A CLUSTERFUCK TO PROPERLY UNPACK/PACK. HOW DO YOU EVEN READ THIS YOURSELF
								 ## HAVE TO SHIFT ALL ENTRIES BY 1 AND RESOLVE LAST TWO MANUALLY -.-
								 ## See Extra Notes for some insight!
Animation Name Offset | 4 Bytes
Animation Size Offset | 4 Bytes

>> ANIMATION ENTRY (FROM OFFSET) << 
Animation Start | 0x0
Animation Size | 0x8, 4 Bytes (necessary for extraction, length of .anm)

>> ANIMATION NAME ENTRY (FROM OFFSET) <<
Object Name (no extension) | String, Variable Length, Delimited/Finished by \x00

----------------
Note:

Unknown #3 is an offset leads to a set of values. 
It appears to be some sort of set of properties, which are always almost the same.
The entries are two 4 Byte values.
Typically separated by 0x8 Bytes.
Not all animations have an entry for this.

First Value always seems to lead to the first animation name offset.
This is 0x20; I'm assuming this to be an offset from the END of the file.
Edit: Changing this, actually it's likely to be length of 1st entry.

Second Value seems to lead to an unknown section, which may contain data.
This is immediately after the last file;
This section always ends with "FF";
This is typically 276 Bytes long from Normal, sometimes shorter and sometimes nonexistant;
I believe to do with control/following of the 2P (or "2nd controller") character.

///---
But Maria has 84 Bytes... And 41 40 where Sonic 40 40
And Charmy Doesn't even have this section...
///---

Second value has typical diffs between chars:
Base Difference: 0x38 + Every 0x60 | Short
Example: 
	Sonic | 40 00
	Amy   | 3F 80
	Knux  | 40 80
	Maria | N/A Short section.
	Bee   | Doesn't even have this.

Third Values (99% Time): 00 01 00 04 00 00 FF FF
----------------

This should be enough to write an unpacker/repacker, which is what I'm doing this very moment.
