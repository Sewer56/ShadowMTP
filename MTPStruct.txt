>> HEADER <<
Unknown #1 (Activator?) | 2 bytes   (Generally 00 01)
Animation Count 	 | 2 bytes
Unknown #2 (Activator?) | 2 bytes   (Generally 00 01)

Padding 			 | 0xA bytes ## EDIT: NO PADDING, IT'S THE FIRST BLANK ENTRY.
								 ## PS. If the program ever breaks it's because of this entry!
								 ## This is a pointer to the table of actual values, 12 bytes long. No problemo!

>> DATA INFO/OFFSET TABLE (Starting at 0x10), This repeats for Animation Count Entries <<

Animation Name Offset | 4 Bytes
Animation Data Offset | 4 Bytes
Object Property Offset | 4 Bytes ## THIS IS AN OFFSET TO BEGINNING OF THE PREVIOUS! PROPERTY.
							     ## FOR THE FIRST PROPERTY, IT IS THE LENGTH OF THE SPECIFIC PROPERTY AT START OF MISC PROPERTIES.
								 ## WTF SANIC TEEM, THIS FORMAT IS A CLUSTERFUCK TO PROPERLY UNPACK/PACK. HOW DO YOU EVEN READ THIS YOURSELF
								 ## HAVE TO SHIFT ALL ENTRIES BY 1 AND RESOLVE LAST TWO MANUALLY -.-
								 ## See Extra Notes for some insight!
								 
								 ## Edit: Seems I was wrong, it's just that the first entry is 'special' in unprecendented ways!
								 ## It's even padded with 00 00 00 00 at the end.
								 ## But buahahahhahahahahah! The way I written my decompressor in the first way... a few hacks here and there...
								 ## and it extracts it all correctly anyway! (With all samples tested)
								 
								 ## PS. This was originally first in this table, but I moved here such that it is indeed correct now.
								 ## PS. The repacker will do the job properly.

>> ANIMATION ENTRY (FROM OFFSET) << 
Animation Start | 0x0
Animation Size | 0x8, 4 Bytes (necessary for extraction, length of .anm)

>> ANIMATION NAME ENTRY (FROM OFFSET) <<
Object Name (no extension) | String, Variable Length, Delimited/Finished by \x00 (s)
							 ## May not be necessary, but total length + delimiters is always a multiple of 0x4 Byte(s)

----------------
Note:

Unknown #3 is an offset leads to a set of values. 
It appears to be some sort of set of properties, which are always almost the same.
The entries are two 4 Byte values.
Typically separated by 0x8 Bytes.
Not all animations have an entry for this.

First Value always seems to lead to the first animation name offset.
This is 0x20; I'm assuming this to be an offset from the END of the file.
Edit: Changing this, actually it's likely to be length of 1st entry.

Second Value seems to lead to an unknown section, which may contain data.
This is immediately after the last file;
This section always ends with "FF";
This is typically 276 Bytes long from Normal, sometimes shorter and sometimes nonexistant;
I believe to do with control/following of the 2P (or "2nd controller") character.

///---
But Maria has 84 Bytes... And 41 40 where Sonic 40 40
And Charmy Doesn't even have this section...
///---

Second value has typical diffs between chars:
Base Difference: 0x38 + Every 0x60 | Short
Example: 
	Sonic | 40 00
	Amy   | 3F 80
	Knux  | 40 80
	Maria | N/A Short section.
	Bee   | Doesn't even have this.

Third Values (99% Time): 00 01 00 04 00 00 FF FF
----------------

This should be enough to write an unpacker/repacker, which is what I'm doing this very moment.
